# Git and GitHub
- Git is a version Control Toll which is used to manage the different versions of your application. 
- Generally, in software development or in IT industry, we work on multiple projects. We need work on them to improve their efficiency or to include new features into it, etc. 
- Sometimes, we make wonder afte implementing new snippets of code or features it doesn't work like before and not reach the expectations that we want our product as to function.
- We feel like, it would be better If my application works the same as it was before. So, to make that happen `Git` helps us. 
- This tool keeps track of your project directory. So, whenever you commit any changes in the files of your project it automatically grasp it and helps us to revert back the previous versions of it whenever we want. 
- And `GitHub` is a tool or webapp which helps us to store our project files which can be helpful for open source contribution. 
- People all around the world, contribute to the projects and to keep track on those files is `Git` work. Like who contributed it, when, their name, issue solved, etc. 
- To check whether `Git` is installed or not, just open terminal and type `git`. If you get anything list format then you are successful. Don't worry if you don't understand all those lines we cover them later on.
- `mkdir Project` - Create Directory
- `cd Project` - enter into that directory
- To store all the project tracking files, we need to give a command as `git init`
- Which initializes the project and helps us to track them easily 
- It is hidden folder, to see it give command as `ls -a` 
- It keeps tracking this directory if I commit any changes to it, it records it. 
- `git status` - To know what are the changes have been commited into the directory. 
- People who are watching the repo doesn't know that you've commited a change until you commit these files to the repository.
