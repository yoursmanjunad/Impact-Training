# Linked List Problems with Solution
- This folder in this training is all dedicated to solve the linked list problems and note all the important topics, concepts , terminologies and tricks to solve the problems. 
- First, we solve the basic of Linked list and grab some grip on it. 
- Then, we try to solve questions on Leetcode, Gfg, and other platforms. 
## To do
- [x] Create a Linked List
- [x] Insert Values in it
- [x] Insert in between two nodes

- [x] Traverse and print the size
- [x] Traverse and print the List 
- [ ] Take input and update the list with Node number, and Node value
- [ ] Search in the list, if it is present, return True, else false Node value or -1
- [ ] Search a value, if it is not present in the list, then add a new node into it and print the list, else return false.
