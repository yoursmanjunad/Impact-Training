-[ ] Code files with proper testcases and quality of code
-[ ] Write these programs in Java and C


### Functions provides better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.
### Based on the object python stores the value in the variable
### Internal working of function / python , why python allows us to use function without defining. Compare with C/Java
### does it occupy space when you declare a function. how memory management works for function?
### Why always functions enters into the stack when we call? 
- DocString - The documentation string of a function is Docstring, it is like commentation, syntax is 
  " ...  " in between double quotes
- We can return any datatype from function instead of using a single datatype.
- Pass by reference or value
- Before coding, we have to write TestCases
# Question - 1
wap to find the n-th number made of prime digits

input format:

first line of input conatians T number of test cases
second line of input contains of input number N

out put:

prime the N th number of sequence and it should be only prime

constriants:

1<=T<=100
1<=N<=10000

intput:
1
10

out put:

33

- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
- 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
- 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
- 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40
- Can be solved using in three ways using List, if and other
- How lists works in background 

- What eveer might be the order of passing arguments, to get the parameters in the same defined manner,we can use variables and assigning values to it so that even after giving the vaiables in random order, function can easily catch them and perform instruction easily
