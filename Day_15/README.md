# Linked List - Python
- Class variable and Instance Variable
- Instance variables are not accessible using the class name, but class variables can access it. 
- To access instance variable, we have to create a `object`. if we try to use it without object creation, we get `Attribute Error`
- Private decleration of variables is using `_`
- To inherit the method's variable, we cannot do it.
